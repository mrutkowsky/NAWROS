## **NARWOS-NLP**
**NARWOS-NLP** is a tool for giving early information about issues supporting relations with customers. The software uses multiple machine learning techniques to produce groups of issues that are similar after receiving an excel or csv file containing user issue reports from the Samsung Members app as an input. Reports generated by the clustering procedure can be filtered, enhanced with fresh data, and downloaded in a variety of formats (details, groups, comparisons). The objective is to give user customizable data insight and support the detection of bugs and problems users are facing.
